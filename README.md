This is a program to index and an application to search for emails.

For the backend Golang is the main language used and Chi for the routing.

To index all the data I use Zincsearch.

Vue is used in the frontend with Tailwind.

Also, I implemented benchmarks to see the program performance and improve it.

Soon, this project will be on my portfolio for you to see it.
